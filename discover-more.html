            Located 2 minutes by car to the river and 5 minutes walking to the town center, this 50s farm house allies modern comfort with its rustic charm.
        </p>
        <p>
            Surrounded by trees, a swimming pool, a patio kissed by the sun, and plenty of space to relax.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our sweet donkey, Chiquinha, lives nearby, in her own area.
